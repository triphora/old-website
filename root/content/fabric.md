# Fabric Loader

*First published: 2021-01-05 | Last updated: 2021-04-30*

The Fabric Loader is a modern, open source, free, and lightweight mod loader for Minecraft since version 1.14. If you use Forge, vanilla, or OptiFine on a day-to-day basis when playing on 1.14+, I would recommend checking out Fabric.

This is a reference page for links with guides that I have made for Fabric.
