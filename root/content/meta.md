# Meta & Contact Info

*First published: 2021-05-09 | Last updated: 2021-05-09*

## What is this site?

Honestly? Not sure. I use it mostly for sharing information I've amassed over my time here on [the interblag](https://xkcd.com/181/). Why? Well, why not?

On the technical level, this site is hosted by Vercel and powered by Docc, a theme for Gridsome using Vue & TailwindCSS. For the longest time this was just plain HTML & CSS, but for whatever reason I decided to start using this on 2021-05-09 ([the superior date format](https://xkcd.com/1179/)).

The source for the website itself is licensed under the MIT License, but any markdown files are licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3 or later. These licenses may or may not apply to any external links, even if those links contain content written by me.

Whatever's posted on here is ordered in chronological order, with the exception of this very page. If I remember to do it, each page will have a "First published" and "Last modified" date near the bottom, but if it doesn't, you can just check the Git log (repo link in the top-right).

## Contact

I go by the aliases of Emmaffle and wafflecoffee online.

[webmaster@waffle.coffee](mailto:webmaster@waffle.coffee) is the email you should use for any website-related issues.

I also have Discord if you prefer that; Emmaffle#1787 is my handle.

I've also a [GitHub account](https://github.com/wafflecoffee) and a [Steam account](https://steamcommunity.com/id/wafflecoffee), as well as five Minecraft accounts: wafflecoffee, DiamondBreakfast, GoldenBreakfast, IronBreakfast, and Emmaffle.
