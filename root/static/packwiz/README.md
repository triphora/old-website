# waffle's Mods

***Featuring the [Empire Minecraft Utilities](https://modrinth.com/mod/emcutils) mod, made by [GreenMeanie](https://u.emc.gs/GreenMeanie) with help from yours truly!***

Don't want to update your Fabric mods? Let me do it for you! I set up this here mod playlist that downloads the latest of a predefined set of mods. This is an easier way to download one thing to get all of the mods included instead of having to download up to 52 separate mods.

Feel free to remove or add any (compatible, [approved](https://mods.emc.gs)) mods!

**Please read the [Conditionally Approved Mods](https://wiki.emc.gs/conditionally-approved-mods) page before using the some of the mods included.**

*Note: Blur is known to be stupidly laggy. Removing this will give a significant performance boost for some.*

## Versions

I have three versions of the playlist.  
* **Sodium** *(recommended)*: This is the set that I use personally. It includes some optional tools that very few people would actually utilise, such as Critical Orientation or WorldEditCUI, and it will prompt you at installation whether you wish to install these optional mods or not. It includes all of the performance-enhancing mods.  
* **OptiFine**: This is the same as the Sodium playlist, but with OptiFine instead of some of the performance enhancing mods. This should only be used if you wish to use shaders.  
* **Snapshot**: This is experimental, and works with the latest snapshot version of Minecraft 1.17. It only uses Modrinth mods, and so the list may be abbreviated from the typical mod list; no mods are optional either. The mod list for this is included in a separate listing below. It is assumed you will run this in singleplayer. **Some of these mods may not be approved for use on Empire Minecraft, so do not use the Snapshot versions there.**

## Installation
### MultiMC

1. Download the Packwiz Installer Bootstrap from [here](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases/download/v0.0.3/packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar), and put it into your Minecraft folder.  
2. Under "Edit Instance", go to "Settings" and then "Custom Commands", and add the following pre-launch command: `"$INST_JAVA" -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://waffle.coffee/packwiz/<DESIRED PACK>/pack.toml`  
    * `{DESIRED PACK}` should be changed to `sodium`, `optifine`, or `snapshot`; whichever one you want.  
3. Use the Export Instance function to export the "pack" as a `.zip` file.  
4. To install the mods, you need to add it with "Add Instance" and "Import from zip".

### Default Launcher
#### Windows
1. Download the Packwiz Installer Bootstrap from [here](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases/download/v0.0.3/packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar), and put it into your Minecraft folder; the base of it, not into the \mods folder.  
    * If you don't know how to navigate here, open the run box with Win + R, and type `%appdata%\.minecraft`.  
2. Open the Command Prompt with Win + R and `cmd`. From there, run the following commands:  
3. `cd %appdata%\.minecraft`  
4. `java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://waffle.coffee/packwiz/<DESIRED PACK>/pack.toml`  
    * `{DESIRED PACK}` should be changed to `sodium`, `optifine`, or `snapshot`; whichever one you want.  
    * If you get a message along the lines of "not found as command, batch file, yadda yadda", you need to install Java. You can find a link [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot).
5. You can close out of Command Prompt now, and delete the Packwiz Bootstrap Installer.

#### Unix (Linux, Mac)
Run the following commands (you can also append `&&` between them):  
1. `cd ~/.minecraft`  
2. `wget https://github.com/comp500/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases/download/v0.0.3/packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar`  
3. `java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://waffle.coffee/packwiz/<DESIRED PACK>/pack.toml`  
    * `{DESIRED PACK}` should be changed to `sodium`, `optifine`, or `snapshot`; whichever one you want.  
    * You can pass `-g` if you want all of the optional mods.
4. `rm -f packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar`  

Change the directory from `~/.minecraft` if you use a different directory, e.g., if you're on Mac, or use Snap or Flatpak.

## Mod List

**Legend:**  
* *Yes* - The mod is always downloaded.  
* *Optional* - The mod is only downloaded if you check the box to, or if you pass the `-g` argument.  
* *No* - This mod conflicts with another included mod, and therefore is not included there.

## Disclaimer
"Mod playlist" is a technical term. It is a bundle of mods that adds no additional features other than automatically downloading a specific precompiled list of mods; by contrast, "modpacks" have custom configs, resource packs, etc. Modpacks require permission from the mod authors, whereas mod playlists do not.
