    <p>I've done a number of things on the Internet, including written pieces, code stuff, etc.</p>
    <h2 id=empire>Empire Minecraft</h2>
    <p>I am a player of a bit under 4 years on a wonderful Minecraft server called <a href=https://ref.emc.gs/wafflecoffee>Empire Minecraft</a>. I am a member of the <a href=https://wiki.emc.gs/community-teams>Contribution Team</a> of EMC, where I help keep the <a href=https://wiki.emc.gs>EMC Wiki</a> up-to-date, relevant, and standardised. (An example of this standardisation is my spearheading of the update of all Custom Item renders from pre-1.14 textures to 1.16).
    <br>I also write blog posts for the <a href=https://blog.emc.gs>EMC Blog</a>, only one of which has been published: <a href=https://empireminecraft.com/blog/reviews/minecraft/2765-whats-new-a-guide-to-the-minecraft-1-16-nether-update-so-far/>What’s New in the Minecraft 1.16 “Nether Update”</a>.</p>
    <h2 id=modrinth>Modrinth</h2>
    <p>I am a File Moderator of and Contributor to <a href=https://modrinth.com>Modrinth</a>, a FOSS modding platform similar to that of CurseForge, but far better. I do some level of quality assurance by ensuring issues with the software powering Modrinth are documented for the developers to remediate.
    <br>I've also submitted a couple minor changes to the website itself, which can be found <a href=https://github.com/modrinth/knossos/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Awafflecoffee>here.</a></p>
    <h3 id=licensing-guide>Mod Licensing Guide</h3>
    <p>Additionally, I've written a blog post for <a href=https://blog.modrinth.com>Modrinth's blog</a> regarding software licensing for Minecraft mods. That guide can be found <a href=https://blog.modrinth.com/licensing-guide>here.</a></p>
    <h2 id=mcmods>Minecraft Mods</h2>
    <p>I've done a bit of work on helping others with Minecraft <a href=./fabric.html>Fabric</a> mod developing, as well as having made a couple of my own.
    <br>The ones listed below are simply my notable creations/contributions, and is not comprehensive of every contribution I've made to projects.</p>
    <h3 id=my-mods>My Mods</h3>
    <p>I've created a few Fabric mods of my own. These can be found on my Modrinth page <a href=https://modrinth.com/user/6plzAzU4>here</a>.</p>
    <h3 id=consistency-plus>Consistency Plus</h3>
    <p>I am a Project Developer of <a href=https://github.com/ConsistencyPlus/ConsistencyPlus>Consistency Plus</a>, a Fabric mod dedicated to resolving disparities between consistency in the number of building blocks and materials provided to the Minecraft player.</p>
    <h3 id=loading-timer>Loading Timer</h3>
    <p>I am a Contributor to <a href=https://github.com/Blobanium/Loading-Timer>Loading Timer</a> (thanks to <a href=https://github.com/Blobanium/Loading-Timer/pull/6>this pull request</a>), a Fabric mod dedicated to giving the user a notification once the game has loaded displaying how much time the game took to load.</p>
