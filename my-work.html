    <p>I've done a number of things on the Internet. Here's a brief summary of some of the important stuff.</p>
    <h2 id=moderation>Community Moderation</h2>
    <p>One of my favourite things to do is assist in keeping various communities safe through moderation roles. These are mostly Discord-centric. Some of the notable communities I help moderate include <a href=https://quiltmc.org>QuiltMC</a>, <a href=https://modrinth.com>Modrinth</a>, and <a href=https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/Fabulously-Optimized>Fabulously Optimized</a>.</p>
      <h3 id=file-moderation>File Moderation</h3>
      <p>Additionally, I am a file moderator for Modrinth. This involves a vigorous review process for new project submissions as well as handling inbound reports for projects, users, or files.</p>
    <h2 id=blog-wiki-docs>Blogs, Wikis, and Documentation</h2>
    <p>I like contributing to blogs, wikis, and documentation. Some of the specifics in this field involve my membership as a <a href=https://wiki.emc.gs/community-teams>Contribution Team</a> member of <a href=https://ref.emc.gs/wafflecoffee>Empire Minecraft</a>, a lovely Minecraft server on which I've played for over four years now. The Contribution Team helps keep the <a href=https://wiki.emc.gs>EMC Wiki</a> up-to-date, relevant, and standardised. I've even spearheaded a couple initiatives on the EMC wiki, including namely the updating of all old textures from pre-1.14 to 1.16+.</p>
    <br>EMC's C-Team also writes blog posts for the <a href=https://blog.emc.gs>EMC Blog</a>, including <a href=https://empireminecraft.com/blog/reviews/minecraft/2765-whats-new-a-guide-to-the-minecraft-1-16-nether-update-so-far/>What’s New in the Minecraft 1.16 “Nether Update”</a> and <a href=https://empireminecraft.com/blog/tips-and-tricks/minecraft-tips-and-tricks/2870-optimizing-minecraft-chest-sorting/>Minecraft for Hoarders: Optimizing Minecraft chest sorting</a>.</p>
    <p><a href=https://blog.modrinth.com>Modrinth also has a blog</a>, on which I've <a href=https://github.com/modrinth/blog/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Awafflecoffee>published a few posts</a>. We also have a <a href=https://docs.modrinth.com>documentation site</a>, which <a href=https://github.com/modrinth/docs/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Awafflecoffee>I've contributed a few things to</a>.</p>
    <h2 id=code>Random dabbling in some code</h2>
    <p>I'm not awfully great at making code, but I sometimes contribute to Java projects, specifically surrounding <a href=./quilt.html>Quilt</a> Minecraft modding. Notable projects which I maintain may be found on my <a href=https://modrinth.com/user/6plzAzU4>Modrinth</a> page. <a href=https://github.com/wafflecoffee>My GitHub profile</a> is mostly dedicated to MC modding and peripheral projects thereof, so feel free to check there for the latest updates.</p>
    <p>Some of my most notable work code-wise is for Modrinth's Gradle plugin, <a href=https://github.com/modrinth/minotaur/commits?author=wafflecoffee>Minotaur</a>, and for Modrinth's frontend, <a href=https://github.com/modrinth/knossos/commits?author=wafflecoffee>knossos</a>. A large portion of my job at Modrinth, though, is feedback providing and quality assurance.</p>
