    <h2 id=info>What is this site?</h2>
    <p>Honestly? Not sure. I use it mostly for sharing information I've amassed over my time here on <a href=https://xkcd.com/181>the interblag</a>. Why? Well, why not?</p>
    <p>On the technical level, this site is hosted by Vercel <del>and powered by Docc, a theme for Gridsome using Vue &amp; TailwindCSS. For the longest time this was just plain HTML &amp; CSS, but for whatever reason I decided to start using this on 2021-05-09 (<a href=https://xkcd.com/1179>the superior date format</a>).</del></p>
    <p>This site is back to the old-school raw HTML &amp; CSS, as of 2021-05-23 (<a href=https://xkcd.com/1179>still the superior date format</a>).</p>
    <p>This website has previously been licensed under varying licenses, including the CC0-1.0, Unlicense, GFDL-1.3-only, and MIT. This website is now licensed under the CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0.</p>
    <p>Whatever's posted on here is ordered in chronological order, with the exception of this very page. If I remember to do it, each page will have a 'First published' and 'Last modified' date near the bottom, but if it doesn't, you can just check the <a href=https://github.com/wafflecoffee/waffle.coffee>Git log</a>.</p>
    <h2 id=contact>Contact</h2>
    <p>I go by the aliases of Emmaffle and wafflecoffee online.</p>
    <p>If you find anything wrong with this website, use the email webmaster@waffle.coffee.</p>
    <p>I also have Discord if you prefer that; Emmaffle#1787 is my handle.</p>
    <p>I've also a <a href=https://github.com/wafflecoffee>GitHub account</a>, a <a href=https://tech.lgbt/@waffle rel=me>Mastodon</a>, and a <a href=https://steamcommunity.com/id/wafflecoffee>Steam account</a>, as well as five Minecraft accounts: wafflecoffee, DiamondBreakfast, GoldenBreakfast, IronBreakfast, and Emmaffle.</p>
