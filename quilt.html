    <p><a href=https://quiltmc.org>The Quilt Project</a> is a modern, open source, free, and lightweight mod loader for Minecraft since version 1.18.2, forked from the similar Fabric Project. If you use Fabric, Forge, vanilla, or OptiFine on a day-to-day basis when playing on 1.18.2 or above, I would recommend checking out Quilt.</p>
    <p>Quilt forked from Fabric for a good number of reasons, the primary of which was due to lack of proper moderation or administration. A good portion of the rationale for Quilt forking can be found in <a href=https://gist.github.com/leo60228/7a185bea0ac0a7f16b0f393cd888f08d>this gist</a>.</p>
    <p>This is a reference page for links with guides that I have made for Quilt.</p>
